# TailwindCSS w/HTML Workspace

## Getting Started
When first downloading, run `$ npm install` to install TailwindCSS & other dependencies. 

## Building CSS
Run `$ npm run build-css` to compile the TailwindCSS anytime you make an update to it.

## Using Tailwind from the Internet
The `index.html` file contains a CDN link with instructions; use it if TailwindCSS fails to build locally for whatever reason.
